# Run length encoding and decoding ðŸ‘»

Run-Length Encoding _(RLE)_ is a simple data compression technique that reduces the size of repetitive data. It works by replacing consecutive identical elements with a single element and a count. 

For example, the string AAABBBCCDAA becomes 3A3B2C1D2A. This method is effective for compressing data with many repeated elements and is commonly used in simple graphics formats.

**Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$

**Space Complexity**: 
$$O(n)$$
